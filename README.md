# Aman Kardam p5.js Sketches 
## List of All of my Sketches
### 1. [Recursive Square Rotating Animation](https://amankardam.github.io/P5-Javascript-Sketches/Reus_sq/src/)
- In this animation we created a function which recursively call to draw a square with redued length by some factor each time with having same center for all square and stop when length is less than 1. Simntenously we rotate the drawed square with some speed which we can control through slider.

    
### 2. [Single Player Ping Pong Game](https://amankardam.github.io/P5-Javascript-Sketches/pin_pong/src/)
- Here we designed a single player ping pong in which ball is reflected bay all 3 wall expect one wall which is protected by pong . We have 2 ball in game 1 black , 2 random color . We would make sure that black ball shouldnn't touch 4th wall , if touched game over. 2nd ball is basically to cause confusion it can touch all for walls. We can change the size of pong with the help of slider . Pong response in y axis caputure movement by mouse or touch.


### 3. [Factral Tree](https://amankardam.github.io/P5-Javascript-Sketches/f/src/)
- In this we use factorial function , draw a tree with 1 branch which call 2 other branch with reduced length and those 2 branch call 2 branch 2,2 each branch and so on. When length is less than 1 it stop drawing. we have two slider which set angle of rotation for both branch respectively.
